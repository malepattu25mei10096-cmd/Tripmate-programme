TripMate – Car Pooling Management System (Python)

A simple and efficient car-pooling ride management program built using Python.
This project demonstrates the use of lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and user-input handling—ideal for academic evaluation and beginner-level software design.
TripMate is a command-line application that allows users to add, view, and search carpool rides. The goal is to promote cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation by helping drivers with empty seats connect with passengers traveling on the same route.

#Features

Add rides with driver name, source, destination, seats available, and price 
View all available rides
Search rides by starting location
Beginner-friendly code, easy to understand
Promotes sustainability and reduces carbon emissions

#How It Works

Each ride is stored as a dictionary inside a list named rides.

Example ride:

{
  "driver": "Rahul",
  "from": "Chennai",
  "to": "Bangalore",
  "seats": 2,
  "price": 500
}

The program displays a simple menu where the user can:

1. Add Ride
2. View Rides
3. Search Ride
4. Exit

#Objectives of the Project

Build a functional real-world Python mini-application
Encourage eco-friendly car pooling
Practice CRUD-like functionality (Add, Read, Search operations)
Demonstrate menu-driven programming
Use data structures like lists and dictionaries effectively

#Future Improvements

🔹 Store rides in a file (CSV/JSON)
🔹 Create login system for drivers and passengers
🔹 Add booking confirmation
🔹 Create GUI or webpage
🔹 Add route suggestions using maps

# Conclusion

TripMate demonstrates how Python can be used to build simple, useful, and environmentally beneficial applications.
It is an excellent beginner project focusing on logic building, sustainability awareness, and clean coding practices.
